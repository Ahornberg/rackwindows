# A collection of VCV Rack modules based on audio plugins by Chris Johnson from Airwindows

![Rackwindows Modules](res/images/rackwindows_panels.jpg)

Most of these modules are straight-up ports of [Airwindows](http://www.airwindows.com) plugins with the addition of a panel (designed to be potentially buildable in hardware) and the occasional tweak or enhancement to take advantage of the modular environment.

Airwindows plugins are known for exceptional sound quality, innovative approaches and minimalist interfaces. They often focus on and excel at one specific task, which is why I think they are a natural fit for Rack.

For more in-depth information about the inner workings of a particular Airwindows plugin please check Chris' [website](http://www.airwindows.com). There is a video on every plugin along with a description and I encourage everyone to explore his body of work. Chances are you stumble upon other gems here and there. He's got a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/airwindows) in case you appreciate and want to support what he does.

## Capacitor <a id="capacitor"></a>

Filters

![Rackwindows Capacitor](res/images/capacitor_panels.jpg)

Comes in both mono and stereo, with the stereo version featuring an additional dry/wet control.

## Chorus <a id="chorus"></a>

Chorus with multi-tap option (Ensemble) 

![Rackwindows Chorus](res/images/chorus_panels.jpg)

This surprisingly versatile module is a combination of Airwindows Chorus and ChorusEnsemble. The switch lets you toggle between the two flavours.

## Distance <a id="distance"></a>

Designed to mimic through-air high frequency attenuation

![Rackwindows Distance](res/images/distance_panels.jpg)

Pushes things back. Also quite nice on reverb returns.

## Dual BSG <a id="dual-bsg"></a>

Dual gain shifter

![Rackwindows Dual BSG](res/images/dual_bsg_panels.jpg)

Scales a signal up or down by increments of exactly 6 dB. If no input is connected, the respective output will provide constant voltage selectable in 1V steps from -8V to +8V. The lower section can be linked to the upper one to automatically compensate for values set by the upper 'Shift' knob, in which case the lower 'Shift' knob can be used to offset the signal in 6db steps (input connected) or 1V steps (input not connected).

## Hombre <a id="hombre"></a>

Texas tone and texture

![Rackwindows Hombre](res/images/hombre_panels.jpg)

[More information...](http://www.airwindows.com/hombre-vst)

## MV <a id="mv"></a>

Dual-mono reverb

![Rackwindows MV](res/images/mv_panels.jpg)

A reverb based on Bitshiftgain and old Alesis Midiverbs. Capable of turning everything into a pad or sustaining a 'bloom' forever. Watch your volume though when using small amounts of depth with full on regeneration.

## Tremolo <a id="tremolo"></a>

Organic pulsating thing

![Rackwindows Tremolo](res/images/tremolo_panels.jpg)

Instead of volume animation Tremolo uses fluctuating saturation and antisaturation curves to create a more organic, somewhat tubey tremolo effect.

## Vibrato <a id="vibrato"></a>

FM Vibrator o_O

![Rackwindows Vibrato](res/images/vibrato_panels.jpg)

Make sure to also play with the 'Inverse/Wet' knob for chorusing and flange effects. Two trigger outputs have been added for fun.
