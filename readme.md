# A collection of VCV Rack modules based on audio plugins by Chris Johnson from Airwindows

![Rackwindows Modules](res/images/modules.jpg)

NOTE: As of now, this collection is still a work in progress.

Most of these modules are straight-up ports of [Airwindows](http://www.airwindows.com) plugins with the addition of a panel (designed to be potentially buildable in hardware) and the occasional tweak or enhancement here and there to take advantage of the modular environment.

Airwindows plugins are known for exceptional sound quality, innovative approaches and minimalist interfaces. They often focus on and excel at one specific task, which is why I think they are a natural fit for Rack.

For more in-depth information on the inner workings of a particular Airwindows plugin please check Chris' [website](http://www.airwindows.com). There is a video on every plugin along with a description and I encourage everyone to explore his body of work. Chances are you stumble upon other gems here and there. He's got a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/airwindows) if you appreciate and want to support what he does.
